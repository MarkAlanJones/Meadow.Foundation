# Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Distance.A02yyuw

**A02yyuw serial ultrasonic distance sensor**

The **A02yyuw** library is included in the **Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Distance.A02yyuw** nuget package and is designed for the [Wilderness Labs](www.wildernesslabs.co) Meadow .NET IoT platform.

This driver is part of the [Meadow.Foundation](https://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Meadow.Foundation/) peripherals library, an open-source repository of drivers and libraries that streamline and simplify adding hardware to your C# .NET Meadow IoT applications.

For more information on developing for Meadow, visit [developer.wildernesslabs.co](http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/).

## Installation

You can install the library from within Visual studio using the the NuGet Package Manager or from the command line using the .NET CLI:

`dotnet add package Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Distance.A02yyuw`
## Usage

```csharp
A02yyuw a02yyuw;

public override Task Initialize()
{
    Resolver.Log.Info("Initialize...");

    a02yyuw = new A02yyuw(Device, Device.PlatformOS.GetSerialPortName("COM4"));

    var consumer = A02yyuw.CreateObserver(
        handler: result =>
        {
            Resolver.Log.Info($"Observer: Distance changed by threshold; new distance: {result.New.Centimeters:N1}cm, old: {result.Old?.Centimeters:N1}cm");
        },
        filter: result =>
        {
            if (result.Old is { } old)
            {
                return Math.Abs((result.New - old).Centimeters) > 5.0;
            }
            return false;
        }
    );
    a02yyuw.Subscribe(consumer);

    a02yyuw.Updated += A02yyuw_DistanceUpdated;

    return Task.CompletedTask;
}

public override async Task Run()
{
    Resolver.Log.Info("Run...");

    var distance = await a02yyuw.Read();
    Resolver.Log.Info($"Initial distance is: {distance.Centimeters:N1}cm / {distance.Inches:N1}in");

    a02yyuw.StartUpdating(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2));
}

private void A02yyuw_DistanceUpdated(object sender, IChangeResult<Length> e)
{
    Resolver.Log.Info($"Distance: {e.New.Centimeters:N1}cm / {e.New.Inches:N1}in");
}

```
